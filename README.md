# GRUB setting script

These are scripts for setting and converting between CLI/GUI mode in Ubuntu 18.04.

You cannot use GUI in CLI mode to get full GPU memory available. That is, in CLI mode, no GPU memory is occupied by default.

Command for set machine to CLI mode:

```
sudo sh set-cli-mode
sudo reboot
```


Command for set machine to GUI mode:
```
sudo sh set-gui-mode
sudo reboot
```
